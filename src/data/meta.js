  summary: "I'm a research-minded systems engineering graduate who's intent on using data and modeling to improve human quality of life with physical and informational infrastructure. I bring four years of experience designing and implementing technology for public and civic service in research and government, alongside over six years of combined academic, professional, and personal software engineering experience. I'm particularly strong in taking systems apart mentally—quickly identifying accessibility issues in designs; evaluating architectural tradeoffs in complex, digital systems; and anticipating risks and failure modes across lifecycles."
